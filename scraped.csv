To do that, they need powerful knowledge resources — and the means to track their effectiveness. In fact, we know that the best knowledge centered services are also the most organized and actionable. But this presents a challenge: Agents struggle with knowledge management because it's hard to write, maintain, and track within the enterprise. So, how can we make sure our knowledge centered services are actually creating an impact? Keep reading to find out. This guide will provide a comprehensive look into what knowledge centered service is, the benefits and challenges of providing it, and how you can incorporate it into your organization.   What does knowledge centered service (KCS) mean?  Organizations use knowledge centered service to gain visibility into every aspect of the knowledge support environment within their business. By managing, distributing, and tracking knowledge across the whole enterprise, leaders can more quickly resolve employees' problems — and in many cases, prevent incidents from happening before they arise. In action, this looks like detailed documentation, knowledge sharing, and data-driven insights into how knowledge actually gets used.   What's the difference between knowledge centered service and knowledge centered support?  Until recently, the more commonly used term was knowledge centered support. The focus of this process was always to offer the best customer and employee support, while also creating and maintaining documentation.  Knowledge centered service was adopted to expand the focus from simply offering support to improving every aspect of the ITSM.   3 Benefits of providing knowledge centered service  There are many reasons why KCS is the dominant way to run your help desk, but an overarching theme emerges time and time again: This system can scale your help desk even with limited resources. These three value-adds can help you do just that.   1. Reduce time to resolution by encouraging self-service  When implemented correctly, KCS can encourage your employees to self-serve when issues arise. Over time, your organization will have built up a library of knowledge articles, filled to the brim with solutions. And yet, your agents may find themselves answering the same questions time and time again. KCS can enable employees to search for and find their own answers — dramatically reducing time to resolution.   2. Free up agent time to focus on strategy work  Initially, KCS adoption requires some investment of time, but the time-saving potential of KCS in the post-adoption stage has a monumental impact in the long run. Building a service desk around knowledge will free your help desk agents from having to answer the same set of questions day after day. Instead, as they document solutions, other agents will be able to jump in and reference their approach — saving time and energy for everyone. When KCS is implemented successfully, employee retention and satisfaction can increase dramatically. Employees get solutions faster — and often by themselves. Agents get to turn their attention to strategic work. It's a win-win.   3. Decrease cost-per-ticket  As KCS both reduces the overall tickets by enabling self-service and the amount of time and effort each agent spends on resolving a ticket, this method can substantially cut your cost-per-ticket.   3 Challenges of providing knowledge centered service  We've discussed some ways KCS can deliver tangible benefits to organizations — even with limited resources. However, successful implementation introduces some challenges too.   1. 75% of all articles don't get shown to end-users  While companies do a great job of encouraging their agents to document solutions, they often fall short in helping employees find knowledge base articles. Useful articles get locked away behind confusing portals. Too many employees forget passwords. And the support environment can be so complex, that people give up searching for answers before they even start. Ultimately, employees end up reaching out to their favorite IT agent or filing a ticket instead, waiting several hours or days for a resolution. Vice versa, IT agents end up referencing their own articles over and over, caught in an endless loop of mundane question-answering processes.   2. Articles aren't written with end-users in mind  Articles are written by — and for — IT agents. In fact, our data shows that half of all articles are almost impossible to read given their length. The cycle of knowledge article creation typically follows these steps: Many employees submit a ticket, complaining of a similar issue.An IT agent notices the pattern and writes a knowledge base article documenting their fix.Their fix is centered around their process of fixing the problem — most useful for other IT agents who encounter this ticket.Other employees can't make heads or tails of the KB article and submit a ticket to get help. Instead, industry-leading companies get very prescriptive about how to write knowledge base articles. They templatize what a good article looks like. Agents are enabled to write for employees — and self-service increases.   3. Defining the success of a knowledge base article is difficult  Many companies don't have metrics defining the success of a knowledge base article. They may track views — but have no way of connecting those views to the next course of action taken by employees who viewed the article. As a result, the IT team may report an increase in views on the knowledge articles they've been working on, even though ticket volume hasn't slowed down. Clearly, there's a disconnect at play. Industry-leading companies clearly define what a good knowledge base article looks like, and how it’s effective. For example, if a particular article is getting a lot of views, tickets relating to that problem should see a drop in volume — an indication that employees are choosing the self-service route.   How to find and interpret knowledge opportunities  Many industry-average companies are aware of the task facing them: They need to overhaul how their employees approach support. But many IT leaders are discovering that it's hard to determine which knowledge topics actually yield impact for employees. There are two big actions you can take to find and interpret these knowledge opportunities: Identify article gapsImprove existing articles by improving content   Find knowledge gaps  According to data across our customer base, 40% of issues employees raise go unanswered because of knowledge gaps. While a knowledge gap may be evident to IT agents, it's often much less evident to leaders. By conducting a thorough content audit, however, you can connect the dots between what employees are actively searching for and what knowledge articles you have currently available.   Improve existing articles  All IT teams have a library of knowledge articles — but are all of them effective employee resources? To answer that question, conduct an audit of your existing articles, keeping an eye out for the following: Incorrect content: Is there any important information that's outdated or stale? (i.e. an old wifi password)Incomplete content: Is there any critical information missing? What’s common knowledge for IT agents is often critical information for employees who want to self-serve.Difficult to process: Is the article easy for employees to read and understand? Watch out for long paragraphs, overused jargon, or a failure to outline steps.Discoverability issues: Is your article easy to find? When employees raise an issue, were they directed to the article that could've enabled them to self-serve?Article grooming: Is your article still relevant? Many articles will reach their expiration date naturally — it's important to have a process in place to determine which articles to retire or update.   Knowledge as a service  To be the most effective organization in building and maintaining KCS, leaders have to start thinking about knowledge as a service they’re providing to their employees. Industry-leading companies often empower centralized knowledge teams to oversee the process of creating and maintaining knowledge. They also: Set the standards of success at every level of KCSManage change in the overall strategyDirect teams within other departments on how to build and document knowledge to support employeesHave the formal authority to address knowledge gaps Ultimately, employees are looking for a seamless employee experience — they don’t want to wait several hours for simple tasks that block their productivity. Adopting knowledge centered services is a significant first step to addressing these concerns.  To go beyond, consider creating a conversational AI strategy.          Platform Product Overview How it Works What's New Employee Experience Insights Multilingual Support Intelligence Engine Triage Integration Partners Performance Dashboards Solutions IT HR Facilities Finance Employee Communications Resources Resource Center Blog Help Center System Status Sitemap API Docs Company About us Contact us Newsroom Careers Guides Conversational AI strategy Writing knowledge base articles Speed up your help desk Why service desk automation?

A conversational AI strategy describes how companies implement and improve an automated process for supporting employees, using a conversational AI platform that resolves their requests. Conversational AI has become a necessity in the workplace. AI platforms can resolve thousands of IT support issues, HR service requests, and policy questions at the speed employees expect while freeing up support teams to focus on high-impact projects. Despite the importance of these platforms, there aren’t many resources about how to create an overall strategy for supporting employees with conversational AI, from increasing user adoption to addressing knowledge gaps. The leaders who succeed with AI develop a strategy that guides their technology decisions — not vice versa.   1. Prioritize employee experience when evaluating conversational AI  There are many factors worth considering to find the right AI platform for your business, including integrations, implementation time, analytics, and more. However, we recommend ranking employee experience as your top priority. If employees have a frustrating interaction with your conversational AI platform, they’ll never use it again — no matter its capabilities. So what causes these frustrating interactions? Typically, they’re the product of the “do-it-yourself” approach to AI, where support teams build their own hard-coded dialog flows to address common requests and questions. The problem is that conversation can’t be hard-coded: companies evolve, resources become out-of-date, and users change topics without warning. As a result, it’s critical to work backward from an AI platform that engages with employees in unscripted conversations, rather than trying to solve a few specific use cases. Here’s how Slack improved employee experience with conversational AI   2. Optimize your knowledge base for bite-sized solutions  Once you’ve deployed a conversational AI system that understands employees, you need to create self-service resources to resolve their issues. And because nearly 30% of these issues are knowledge-seeking questions, according to our internal data, the best place to start is optimizing your knowledge base for conversational AI. When done correctly, every policy document, FAQ sheet, and troubleshooting guide is an opportunity to solve thousands of support issues — by surfacing the right snippet of text with AI. That means ensuring that each knowledge article covers only a single topic, is clearly organized into discrete sections, and is written with non-technical language. When employees go searching for answers, the last thing they want to do is spend 20 minutes reading an article for the one sentence they need. A well-organized knowledge base allows your conversational AI platform to find that sentence automatically. Read how Broadcom automated 55% of IT issues by optimizing its knowledge base    3. Create automated workflows for common support issues  Beyond answering questions, an advanced conversational AI strategy allows companies to automate workflows and accelerate approvals. First, take the time to define how your team resolves common issues, such as provisioning software licenses and approving hardware orders. Which applications are involved? How do you enforce user permissions? And who needs to sign off? By clearly documenting the entire process, you can often reduce or eliminate the need for agent intervention, even for high-touch issues. And for requests that do require an expert to solve, conversational AI can accelerate the process by routing the request to the appropriate team.   4. Create a data-driven process for improving coverage  An effective conversational AI strategy is evolving — not static. Its foundation is data, which reveals the most frequent requests and questions from employees, the most valuable knowledge articles and forms, and the most impactful use cases for additional automation. That’s why it’s crucial to have total visibility over your conversational AI platform, so you can not only understand but also anticipate what employees need. With this data in hand, you can build a positive feedback loop — where each issue submitted to the platform helps your team improve its future performance. Here’s how Verisk makes data-driven decisions   Drive employee adoption with proactive communication  Of course, all of this is for naught if your employees don’t use the conversational AI tool you’ve worked so hard to integrate. To drive employee engagement, make this tool the easiest possible thing to use. Have a clear employee adoption strategy, with every avenue of support integrated with your conversational AI system. A great conversational AI strategy will keep the end-user in mind. It will help you to communicate with your employees with ease, without your messages getting ignored. Most importantly, implementing a conversational AI strategy should free your agents from busywork, and enable them to focus on deeper, more meaningful work.  Implementing a conversational AI strategy is the future of employee experience. Every employee, regardless of location, language, or role, deserves the same level of support — and we hope this strategy overview helps you get there.

As an IT leader, you want your employees to get the help they need without having to file a ticket and wait hours and days. This is the goal of every knowledge base article. A good knowledge article can help employees and agents alike — because self-service increases the productivity of the entire organization. We've helped hundreds of companies perfect their knowledge base, and now we're ready to share what we've learned. There are three parts that come into play when writing a knowledge article: Identifying the right structureDifferentiating between different types of articlesEnabling your employees to self-service   Structure of a knowledge base article  The best knowledge base articles are easy to understand. So, we recommend establishing a clear writing style within your organization and enabling every person who writes knowledge base articles to use it. The best articles: Use simple language. They don't rely on jargon.Are organized in an intuitive way.Focus on a single topic.    Effective headlines   The best headlines are simple and clear. Don't write titles that only focus on a problem's symptom — as they may vary across employees. When writing headlines, mention the main subject prominently. If your organization uses two different communications platforms, include the name in your title. For example, ""setting up Zoom video conferencing"" is a clear title that lets the employees know exactly how they'll be helped. Add contextual information only if it helps differentiate the article. For example: ""setting up printers in the Austin office"" vs ""setting up printers in the Toronto office"". Establish and use the same contextual information across all knowledge base articles.   Writing the content  Establish the context of each article immediately. For example, an article applying only to Mac OS users should state that upfront, preferably in the title. Don't rely on organizational hierarchies — tell the reader exactly how the article is relevant to them in the title and body of the article. The best way to write an effective knowledge base article is to talk like your end-users. Try to use the terminology your employees use — including adding keywords that describe symptoms. For example, users may say ""my laptop screen turned blue"" — and if the resulting article doesn't list that symptom, they could assume the article won't resolve their issue. To ensure you're using up-to-date terminology, check out these resources: Google TrendsAnswer the PublicKeyword.io Don't add hyperlinks unless: You can't fit all the information into a single article orYou need to point to information that most readers won't need, but a few might.   How to write different types of knowledge base articles  There are four types of knowledge base articles. Each should be written with the specific goal of enabling self-service.   Task-based articles  Task-based articles provide general overviews of a process and use specific steps to guide employees toward a solution. Most of your knowledge base articles should be of this type. To make it easier for users to find task-based articles, the title should follow the phrase ""I want to know about..."". For example, ""How to connect to the VPN"".   Intro articles  Intro articles will give employees beginner context about a system in your organization. To convey that the article provides background information (rather than a how-to procedure), start the title with ""about..."" or ""what is..."".   FAQ and user guide-style article  Setting up a FAQ is an easy way to address common questions from employees, but to enable self-service, keep your answers short. If a question requires a lot of context or a task procedure is useful, it should have its own article.   Policy articles  These articles explain organizational-level policies or procedures. Choose a title that makes that clear. For example, good titles might start with ""What's our policy for..."" or ""Can I...""   Enabling your employees to self-service  To truly enable self-service and see an impact on your help desk, you need to meet employees where they are — in enterprise chat platforms. Today, however, employees often revert to DMing their preferred IT agent or asking their questions within an existing IT channel. You need to create a single interface for all knowledge — bypassing the frustration an employee feels when they don't know how to get the answers they need. At Consumers Energy, for example, employees are able to engage directly on their enterprise chat platform. They can ask any question from HR to IT and get an answer in minutes. By following this checklist, you can effectively create a knowledge base article that enables self-service for your employees.

IT teams are starting to support a hybrid workforce for the first time while figuring out best practices. It’s difficult as employees are dependent on scattered technology, inter-company communication is challenging, and IT teams can only do so much in a day.  Companies are exploring the hybrid work model best practices, and we’ve distilled the four main things industry-leading enterprises are doing to create a seamless transition.    1. Integrate employee-facing applications  Whether or not we call it a recession, 2022 has been a difficult year for the economy. The US has seen the highest inflation since 1981. The S&P 500 is down 23%, which would be the fourth largest annual drop since the Great Recession era. This economic volatility puts a lot of pressure on CIOs, who are no longer expecting their technology budgets to increase. Clearly, now is the time to think hard about where is the most valuable place to put dollars. According to CIO's 21st annual State of the CIO survey, industry leaders are using this budget in two big ways: Building a digital headquarters.Investing in automation.   Build a digital headquarters to support hybrid work  Employees need one place where they can get help — remote, in-person, or hybrid. The solution we've seen ground-breaking companies turn to is a digital headquarters. The digital HQ is a starting point for everything employees do at work, from holding meetings to sharing files to requesting support. This is different from digital tools, which are meant to support a particular task, such as Google Calendar for scheduling. Having analyzed numerous industry-leading companies, we know that the best of them use an enterprise collaboration hub as the foundation for their digital HQ. Hybrid work best practices for building a digital HQ includes these concrete steps: Organize your collaboration hub.Bring all your employees into the digital HQ.Build seamless integrations between your digital HQ and your digital tools. Industry leaders recognize the inequality of IT support within a global workforce — after all, not even the largest IT team can support every single employee, in every location, in every language. As employees decide to return to the office — or not — companies need to prioritize giving them everything they need to do their best work. A digital headquarters helps to make that transition effortless.   For a seamless transition to hybrid work, invest in automation  Across the globe, a crucial hybrid work best practice is investing in automation. Leaders are hesitant to grow their IT teams. Instead, they're leaning on automation to ease their existing IT team's burden, drive efficiency, and improve company productivity at the same time. AI and automation can be your ticket to ensuring that your IT teams feel supported and not overworked while also offering white-glove support to your employees. Your AI tool of choice should allow you to: Enable seamless onboardingProvide personalized help according to your users' locations, roles, and permissionsAllow employees to return to work or successfully pull off hybrid work The first step for technology leaders is to address IT-facing automation opportunities. Developing automation tools and scripts leads to substantial time savings, as proven by the CIO of Equinix, Milind Wagle. Where industry leaders rise to the challenge, however, is by paying careful attention to the final step of automation: enabling self-service for employees. Successfully solving for self-service can and does take many forms. The core of the challenge — building out a knowledge base, empowering employees to take this new route, and reducing dependency on IT agents — remains the same. The results can bring significant cost savings. According to HDI, a support call can cost as much as $22, while self-service is $2 per incident. Automation lets companies do more with less — support more employees, and increase the efficiency of a smaller IT department.   2. Send targeted employee communications by geography  A hybrid work best practice is to battle communication exhaustion. Industry-leading companies are telling employees exactly what they need to know and meeting employees where they are. These two seemingly small shifts in strategies have shown to have monumental effects on employees and the business.   Tell your employees exactly what they need to know  Employees are laden with messages — from their peers, their direct reports, managers, etc. There's a very likely chance that company-wide alerts get lost in their inbox, buried in portals, and overlooked due to irrelevancy. To combat this, industry leaders are choosing to send out hyper-targeted messages based on their role, department, distribution lists, type of employee, location, and any other information that might be relevant to the communication. Secondly, they use these hyper-targeted messages to drive action. They lead employees to exactly where they need to go. Need people to update their personal information? Add a link to the portal where they can do that. Innovative IT teams make it as easy as possible for people to complete an action.   In an era of hybrid work, meet your employees where they are  More and more employees are spending the majority of their time on enterprise chat platforms. Slack and Microsoft teams have been the primary mode of immediate communication, while portals and emails have the reputation of being overlooked. When employees need IT support in a hybrid work environment, they often don't have the luxury of walking over to their favorite IT agent. They have to muster thorough often chaotic backends. With the shift to enterprise chat, industry leaders can: Improve response time. This becomes crucial with any security issues that come up when employees are at home. Employees are much more likely to check their chat than emails or other portals and respond.Enrich ticket workflows. Communicating via chat allows you to unblock your workforce by giving everyone — from support teams to employees — real-time information and access to what they need.Manage software licenses at scale. Employees may hold many different software licenses without using all of them. By reminding them about unused licenses and providing a way to resolve the issue right away, you can create a frictionless experience and save money.   3. Connect back-end systems  At home, people are used to Netflix's personalized recommendations and Spotify's curated playlists. This lies in stark opposition to their experience at work — disjointed, clunky processes that largely wait for IT agents to comment on tickets. Qualtrics research found that only 30% of employees say that their experience with their company's technology exceeds their expectations. Hybrid work threw this problem into a new light. Across industries, companies were seeing a massive uptick in tickets as remote work began in March 2020. Now, as companies start to define hybrid work best practices, they're starting with back-end systems.   Updating back-end systems  In large organizations, there are an increasing number of tools and portals that employees can use to their advantage. Except, employees don't know what to use. Industry leaders approach this problem at more than just the surface level. The real problem lies in the disarrayed back-end systems. In automating and connecting the many back-end processes that exist in organizations, you can provide a cohesive front to your employees. And because your back-end systems will be ingesting information from every tool, you can drive adoption and usage across every software.   4. Create an experience your employees need  Data suggests the average enterprise uses 288 different SaaS apps across the board. Industry leaders optimize to reach the full potential of each software. So how do you ensure that employees have everything they need?   How to optimize for employee adoption  We know that the most common place employees work and engage today is in enterprise messaging platforms, like Slack and Microsoft Teams. We also know that other employees prefer enterprise portals that they've been navigating for ages. Others like the dependency of email. Proper employee adoption requires a multifaceted approach. Here are the three pillars to your success: Create one place to go to for everything. Don't make employees remember dozens of passwords to different portals. There's plenty going on in their roles without having to learn a new system every time they want to put in PTO or upgrade their laptop.Make the user experience enjoyable. In a hybrid work environment, employees are overloaded with messages, emails, and alerts. Don't add to that cognitive load. Instead, tell your employees only what they need to know. Give them exactly what they ask for.Think long-term. Partner with a strategic team that's dedicated to creating behavior change. It won't happen overnight, and setting unrealistic expectations will cause your project to fail before it fully takes off. Each company will evolve its own hybrid work best practices, but industry leaders will address each 4 of these concerns in their foundations in order to better serve their employees.          Platform Product Overview How it Works What's New Employee Experience Insights Multilingual Support Intelligence Engine Triage Integration Partners Performance Dashboards Solutions IT HR Facilities Finance Employee Communications Resources Resource Center Blog Help Center System Status Sitemap API Docs Company About us Contact us Newsroom Careers Guides Conversational AI strategy Writing knowledge base articles Speed up your help desk Why service desk automation?

The goal of a successful help desk is to solve employee issues as fast as possible. There are many levers a CIO can pull to make that happen — integrations with various tech stacks, increasing the size of your team, or exploring alternative technologies. To find the right lever, we analyzed 16 million support issues from customers BEFORE they implemented a Moveworks bot to determine what actions make the most impact across the board. We set out to answer 3 specific questions: What support channels are employees using today? Which kinds of issues are submitted through the various channels?Is there a better way to improve time-to-resolution?      What support channels are employees using today?  Most IT desks don’t have overarching visibility into ticket categories. But this information is crucial if you truly want to optimize your support environment. With this lack of insight in mind, we categorized millions of issues from nearly 50 enterprise companies. Then, we sorted them into the 5 channels: phone, portal, email, chat, and walk-up. Based on our data, employees preferred to contact IT over the phone 44.2% of the time. We wanted to dig deeper into this — why did employees turn to the phone? Was it the most efficient channel?        Next, we looked to see if there was a relationship between the type of issue and the support channel. Let's look first at what we consider an urgent issue: password resets. We found that employees are most likely to call a help desk agent when locked out of an account — choosing the phone six times more often than other channels. Clearly, employees believe they need to get on the phone with a help desk agent to get help quickly.    What channel do employees turn to when they want to reset their password?   To represent non-urgent issues, we dug into issues related to email distribution lists — a less time-sensitive problem. In this case, employees are twice as likely to turn to the portal channel.   What channel do employees turn to when they want to be added to an email distribution list?   Employees change their behavior based on the urgency of their issue — but is help actually faster from channel to channel? Even though many believe talking to an agent on the phone is faster, we found that it takes agents almost the same amount of time to solve urgent issues over the phone as other channels. On top of that, our data also shows that even when employees use what they perceive to be the fastest support channel, they still end up waiting multiple days for a solution.   How long are employees waiting for a resolution?   As it turns out, the difference between channel speeds is marginal at best. Our data suggests that the quality of support from a particular channel has more to do with the type of issue submitted, than the efficiency of the channel itself. This is because all channels tap into the same backend systems. Either an agent has to solve the problem manually or triages the ticket to someone else who can. So, what's the one thing you can do to speed up your help desk? Short answer: automation. Long answer: The most impactful thing that IT support teams can do is shift their focus from improving individual channels to updating backend support systems. What teams should address is the process of solving issues behind the scenes — with automation. By automating the backend support systems, you can build a strong foundation for improving specific channels or adding new ones. With automation you can: Free up your agents for higher priority workDrastically decrease time-to-resolutionAutomatically triage tickets to the right experts As you incorporate more automation, from troubleshooting to approvals, your time-to-resolution will continue to reduce.

Category-leading companies know that employee experience is important now more than ever. That’s why the best organizations pride themselves on being able to deliver incredible support to every employee — instantly. But, only industry-leading organizations know how to deliver the best support while also: Minimizing burnout within support teamsMeeting their employees where they are — in enterprise chat platformsDelivering equitable support across global teams at a scale In an era when personalized experiences are the norm, organizations are far behind in providing the same. Employees are burnt out. The last thing they need is to wait multiple days for help. So, organizations are using service desk automation to unlock a frictionless employee experience and optimize the IT team.   What is true service desk automation?  Service desk automation is the process of using machine learning and conversational AI to streamline repetitive tasks. It provides service agents with a single platform to resolve customer issues with minimum effort so that they can focus on high-impact work. True automation will offer employees end-to-end support, without relegating your IT agents to building out workflows.   What problems does automation solve?  Right now, agents and employees alike are having a tough time solving for fast employee support. Employees are unable to get fast support for three main reasons: Crucial information is scattered across multiple knowledge bases — making it impossible to find the right one in a timely manner.Enterprise search systems can’t match employee issues with solutions.Employees send thousands of emails to IT agents to solve simple issues, effectively overwhelming support. IT agents are overwhelmed because: They're stuck on mundane tasks, like finding the right knowledge base article.They don’t have any visibility into employee issues — preventing them from addressing the root of the problems — relegating them to a world of nonstop, low-level maintenance.Onboarding is an endless cycle of answering the same questions. To solve all these issues, organizations are turning to an AI service desk and adopting knowledge centered services — with great results.   Building an in-house tool vs buying a tool that integrates  When it comes to introducing service desk automation into your organization, there are two approaches you can take: Build your own automation processes in-house orOnboard an out-of-box solution for end-to-end automation There are benefits and challenges to both, so let’s dive in.   Build-your-own tools  Some organizations choose to build tools in-house. This can offer up a lot of flexibility for service teams to incorporate edge cases, save money in the long run, and align your automation strategy with your organization’s “build in-house” culture. If you have a large team of developers that are passionate about building dialogue flows, customizable scripts, and getting into the nitty-gritty of the building process, building your own tools can be beneficial. It's important to consider what resources you have on offer before building your own in-house automation tool — this approach requires a lot of manual effort, but can be hugely beneficial in the long run.   Out-of-the-box service desk automation  Other organizations choose to implement an existing automation tool. the most effective way to rapidly scale your service desk, without piling work onto your IT team or having to onboard new members. Industry-leading organizations are choosing to pursue this route for many reasons, including: Faster time to value. Because you don’t have to spend time building out each automation, you can start solving problems and creating impact right away.Lower cost of ownership. The right tools will need very little oversight — it won’t be necessary to dedicate an entire team to maintain it.zz   Benefits of Service Desk Automation  No matter which way you choose to automate your service desk, there’s a whole host of benefits that can create a wide-ranging impact. Automation can easily transform your business processes and make your entire organization — from IT agents to employees — a more productive, happier workforce. Let’s take a closer look:   1. Transform business processes  Employees are constantly interacting with existing business processes — through onboarding, requesting access, routine communications, and so much more. Automation is an opportunity to streamline all interactions employees have with the help desk to ease massive amounts of day-to-day friction. Automation is also a massive cost-savings method. It takes, on average, 30 hours for a service desk agent to resolve a ticket, whereas automation can enable self-service and give agents back their time.   2. Increase IT efficiency  Right now, service desk agents may spend their days running after mundane tasks — resetting passwords, routing tickets, or directing people to the right knowledge base article. With service desk automation, organizations can turn the corner towards faster resolution without overburdening agents with manual help.   3. Decrease employee support wait times  Automation can solve common problems instantly, dramatically reducing wait times for employees. Of course, there will always be issues that only a help desk agent can solve. While agents are working on that, you can automate standard employee communications — updating them on the ticket, and keeping them in the loop. With the right automation strategy, you can even proactively engage with employees — solving issues before they become tickets, answering questions before they become blockers. To put this into context, let’s apply these benefits to some everyday use cases.   Top 3 service desk automation use cases  Based on Moveworks data, we know that successful organizations use machine learning and automation for the following three use cases the most effectively: Resetting authenticationProvisioning softwareSending employee communications These use cases come up on a daily basis and every employee is blocked by them multiple times during their tenure. At first glance, an employee facing several challenges during their tenure doesn’t seem like a huge problem. But multiply that with every employee you have. And others who are blocked as a result. Easing day-to-day friction for every employee can be a game-changer. Automation is able to alleviate that pain — and more — exponentially.         Platform Product Overview How it Works What's New Employee Experience Insights Multilingual Support Intelligence Engine Triage Integration Partners Performance Dashboards Solutions IT HR Facilities Finance Employee Communications Resources Resource Center Blog Help Center System Status Sitemap API Docs Company About us Contact us Newsroom Careers Guides Conversational AI strategy Writing knowledge base articles Speed up your help desk Why service desk automation?

Previous Next Pause Play Cost Reduction  Trusted by the best: over 100 Fortune 500 companies choose Moveworks           Multi-LLM Strategy Providing access to multiple LLMs Different large language models perform better at different tasks. You get access to the highest performing models, including: OpenAI’s GPT-4 for search relevance, Google’s BERT for intent classification, and Meta’s RoBERTa for entity recognition.    Enterprise Data Training models collectively Most off-the-shelf LLMs are trained on public data, not your company’s data. Moveworks incorporates secure training data from 500M+ support tickets, 10B+ bot conversations, and 100M+ enterprise resources to ensure the language models understand the language of work.    Entity Grounding Teaching LLMs your business language To maximize factuality and minimize hallucinations from LLMs, you need to automatically send prompts to the LLM  with content of your business. Moveworks automatically mines company specific entities (identity maps, distribution lists, conference room names, software catalog, etc.) and provides that information in every prompt.      Broadcom is resolving 57%+ of IT issues while seeing a 40% reduction in incidents with Moveworks  Find out how All Customer Stories    Model evaluation Constantly swapping out models New models come out every day and perform better at specific tasks than old models. Moveworks is deeply ingrained in the latest research and has access to models before they’re publicly released, meaning we are able to automatically swap them out to maximize performance and accuracy.    Model fine-tuning Providing better model understanding LLMs can’t be fine-tuned with your company data because most of them are too large to host on infrastructure. To perform better than LLMs at specific tasks in the enterprise, Moveworks fine-tunes smaller models with the language of work. This also results in lower latency for the end-user experience.    Model annotation Improving model performance automatically To get the most out of model performance, you need a team to constantly evaluate its performance. At Moveworks, we have a robust annotation operation where trained linguists securely review bot conversations and provide real-time feedback to the models.    Model infrastructure Hosting models for optimal performance & speed Calling large language model APIs for every natural language task can be costly and provide a poor latency experience. Moveworks has built proprietary model infrastructure to host smaller models that are fine-tuned, allowing for better performance and minimal latency.      Conversation experience Handles fluid and dynamic conversation Users speak naturally, and Moveworks understands. Whether it’s in any language, or the user wants to switch topics, or the user doesn’t know what they’re looking for, Moveworks handles the conversation in a delightful way.

Every employee deserves instant support, no matter what language they speak. With Moveworks, employees get support in seconds — simply by asking for help in their native tongue.  Most help desks struggle to support a global workforce: they process thousands of urgent requests from employees, at all hours of the day. But Moveworks resolves these requests in more than 100 languages, completely automatically, so your help desk can deliver high-speed support from Tokyo to Paris to Berlin.      SPA ENG POR FRE GER ITA CHN KOR JPN   Support a Global Workforce. Instantly.   Provides a seamless experience to every employee.  Moveworks provides truly multilingual support to employees in their native language. No training required: employees can get help just by asking. And when they switch languages, Moveworks adapts on a dime.    Built to understand support issues in any language. Moveworks is a one-stop shop for every employee to submit every issue — in every language.  Our platform goes well beyond translation to interpret enterprise jargon, including conference room names, email groups, and company policies. It’s engineered to understand the way employees request help at work.    Delivers personalized solutions to enable self-service. Moveworks provides the right solution to employees’ requests, such as snippets from knowledge articles in the appropriate language. Our platform ingests thousands of support resources, the moment they’re published, so employees don’t need to go digging for what they need.     The only multilingual AI platform created for the enterprise  Moveworks has pioneered the first AI platform that engages employees in their native language, deeply understands their requests, and provides the right resources in real time. Under the hood, we had to evolve the entire Moveworks Intelligence Engine™ to become multilingual: Request a demo   Multilingual conversations.No script needed. Moveworks is designed to engage employees on their terms, without following a script. Now, our platform can switch languages and determine the ideal response on the fly — using machine learning models trained on more than 250 million support requests.  Especially with a multilingual workforce, your support platform needs to hold dynamic conversations to resolve every unique issue. That’s why our conversation engine continuously learns from each interaction, allowing Moveworks to provide a simple, unscripted experience to employees around the world.   An unprecedented understanding of language. Moveworks uses advanced natural language understanding (NLU) to determine exactly what employees need. By building upon our deep knowledge of enterprise terminology, our platform can interpret requests however they’re phrased. This level of NLU requires layers of machine learning models. Our approach allows Moveworks to detect languages with 98% accuracy, make sense of ambiguous entities, correct for grammar and spelling, and identify terms unique to each company.   Personalized help across the globe. Moveworks solves support issues end-to-end by scouring your company for the most useful solution — in the appropriate language. Our platform automatically ingests support resources the moment they’re live, then ranks them with probabilistic machine learning, based on their relevance for the employee.  Support teams create knowledge articles that contain an incredible level of detail. To make that information accessible to employees, we evolved our semantic search system to find the relevant snippet of information across multiple languages.

A $20 billion company with offices and facilities around the globe, Broadcom designs, develops, and manufactures a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Download the PDF     57% Of IT issues resolved autonomously Challenge Integrating new systems into existing IT environment  Result Able to resolve more than half of all tech issues in under a minute       The Problem  Broadcom’s rapid growth requires robust IT integrations  Broadcom is a global infrastructure technology company with a long history of innovation. Over the years, the organization has been aggressive about expansion, resulting in a number of mergers and acquisitions. Andy Nallappan, Vice President and CIO at Broadcom, has seen his company undergo incredible growth and transformation over the years; however, the acquisitions Broadcom has made over the last decade present integration challenges. Information was spread across 10 different knowledge bases, making it difficult for employees to find the right information. As employees rely on an ever-growing number of SaaS applications to keep pace with the fast-moving business, quickly answering their IT questions has never been more critical. They are expected to be increasingly self-sufficient when finding the knowledge they need — like changing their virtual background on Zoom or troubleshooting error messages on Slack. The problem is that knowledge is scattered. And even if employees manage to find the right knowledge base, outdated search systems make it difficult to find the right article.       The Solution  Broadcom integrates its IT environment with AI  In September 2018, Broadcom launched 1.Bot, the company’s internal name for Moveworks. Employees were instantly able to use Google Chat to resolve a variety of issues like resetting passwords, unlocking accounts, creating tickets, checking ticket status, and finding answers from knowledge base articles. Now, Moveworks’ combination of advanced conversational AI and natural language understanding (NLU) enables 1.Bot to resolve employees’ IT support issues conversationally, directly in chat. When the best solution to an issue is in the knowledge base, Moveworks Semantic Search understands the employee’s symptoms to provide the exact, snippet-sized answer they need.           You don’t want your users going all over the place to search for information. The advantage of our Moveworks bot is that there’s one familiar go-to place for employees to get their answers. Stanley Toh Head of End-User Services & Experience        The Result  57% of Broadcom’s IT issues are solved in less than a minute   With an integrated knowledge base, 57% of Broadcom’s IT issues are solved in less than a minute A few years ago, Broadcom set out a vision to integrate the help desk experience for its employees, save time, and reduce the volume of work by automating tasks with AI. In the last two years alone, its IT team has systematically improved its knowledge base using Moveworks’ AI platform.  Today, 1.Bot surfaces answers for employees in less than a minute, pulling information from across all the different knowledge bases and surfacing it in a single interface, Google Chat. With real time visibility over knowledge base gaps, Broadcom's team can create new articles, or update old ones, so employees can self-service their own support. The help desk no longer feels like the ""helpless"" desk. Nallappan’s overall impression of Moveworks is simple and powerful: “It’s AI that really works.”   ← Back to all Customer Stories             Key Integrations           Learn more about Moveworks  How to build a better knowledge base Broadcom explains how it helps employees answer troubleshooting and policy questions instantly with AI.

Previous Next Pause Play Cost Reduction  Trusted by the best: over 100 Fortune 500 companies choose Moveworks           Multi-LLM Strategy Providing access to multiple LLMs Different large language models perform better at different tasks. You get access to the highest performing models, including: OpenAI’s GPT-4 for search relevance, Google’s BERT for intent classification, and Meta’s RoBERTa for entity recognition.    Enterprise Data Training models collectively Most off-the-shelf LLMs are trained on public data, not your company’s data. Moveworks incorporates secure training data from 500M+ support tickets, 10B+ bot conversations, and 100M+ enterprise resources to ensure the language models understand the language of work.    Entity Grounding Teaching LLMs your business language To maximize factuality and minimize hallucinations from LLMs, you need to automatically send prompts to the LLM  with content of your business. Moveworks automatically mines company specific entities (identity maps, distribution lists, conference room names, software catalog, etc.) and provides that information in every prompt.      Broadcom is resolving 57%+ of IT issues while seeing a 40% reduction in incidents with Moveworks  Find out how All Customer Stories    Model evaluation Constantly swapping out models New models come out every day and perform better at specific tasks than old models. Moveworks is deeply ingrained in the latest research and has access to models before they’re publicly released, meaning we are able to automatically swap them out to maximize performance and accuracy.    Model fine-tuning Providing better model understanding LLMs can’t be fine-tuned with your company data because most of them are too large to host on infrastructure. To perform better than LLMs at specific tasks in the enterprise, Moveworks fine-tunes smaller models with the language of work. This also results in lower latency for the end-user experience.    Model annotation Improving model performance automatically To get the most out of model performance, you need a team to constantly evaluate its performance. At Moveworks, we have a robust annotation operation where trained linguists securely review bot conversations and provide real-time feedback to the models.    Model infrastructure Hosting models for optimal performance & speed Calling large language model APIs for every natural language task can be costly and provide a poor latency experience. Moveworks has built proprietary model infrastructure to host smaller models that are fine-tuned, allowing for better performance and minimal latency.      Conversation experience Handles fluid and dynamic conversation Users speak naturally, and Moveworks understands. Whether it’s in any language, or the user wants to switch topics, or the user doesn’t know what they’re looking for, Moveworks handles the conversation in a delightful way.    Search and action reasoning Provides users exactly what they need Businesses have a sea of resources to answer questions: knowledge articles, forms, structured information in backend systems, workflows, and more.

Previous Next Pause Play Text 1  Trusted by CIOs and employee experience leaders everywhere           Home Product    Concierge     Resolve employee issues faster than ever before. By using advanced natural language understanding, Concierge can converse directly with employees, eliminating the need for help desk agents to intervene. This can reduce the time it takes to resolve issues, improving productivity and reducing frustration.    Grant your users unparalleled visibility into their requests. Concierge provides both employees and service desks with unprecedented visibility into support issues. Employees can see the status of their requests in real time, and service desks can track progress and prioritize the most important requests.    Make losing requests a thing of the past. By intelligently managing thousands of interactions, Concierge ensures that nothing gets lost in the shuffle. This can improve the efficiency of employee support and help reduce the workload on support teams.    Features Concierge allows for significant interactivity, providing an automated middle-man between your users and agents. Ticket Notifications Creating & Filing Tickets Viewing Tickets Ticket Comments Closing Tickets Reopening Tickets Multi-domain Concierge    Ticket Notifications Users will automatically receive a ticket notification if an agent adds a comment, there is a significant status change, or a specific amount of time has passed with no change to the ticket.     Creating & Filing Tickets If an issue is not resolved automatically, users have the ability to file a ticket in-chat, creating a ticket at the back-end of your ITSM system for your agents.     Viewing Tickets Users may check on the status of all their tickets anytime or a specific ticket, simply by asking in-chat.     Adding Comments to Tickets Users may add comments in response to agent questions, directly in-chat.     Closing Tickets When a user wishes to close a ticket, they may do so. As a result of this, Moveworks marks the ticket as resolved.     Reopening Tickets When a user wishes to reopen a ticket, they may also do so. As a result of this, Moveworks will update the status of the ticket back to new.     Multi-Domain Concierge Based on the nature of the user’s issue, Moveworks will predict what type of ticket needs to be created. Users can also correct the domain manually if necessary.      One of the things that I use AppDynoBot for, quite frequently, is just inquiring on the status of my open tickets, and that’s something any employee can do, instantly.

But how do you measure “quick”? To help you contextualize your team’s performance, we analyzed IT ticket data from over 100 companies.  We found a dramatic difference between industry-average and industry-leading companies in their mean time to resolution (MTTR). Industry-leading IT teams solved issues in less than half the time. This is a direct result of several key innovations in the IT support process, particularly the use of automation and AI.   How long are employees waiting for support?  *This data represents a sample with selected type of issues.       In this report, we provide help desk benchmarks for high-touch issues, access requests, troubleshooting questions, approvals, and overall MTTR. Across the board, we see a growing divide between the companies that have leaned into innovation and those that haven’t.    High-touch issues submitted to the help desk  Employees with high-touch issues depend on subject matter experts for solutions. Fixing a broken printer or reconfiguring Salesforce requires more than a single help desk agent.  When it comes to high-touch issues, you might assume that automation might hurt, not help. Instead, we’ve found automation is particularly crucial when it comes to solving high-touch issues.    When employees submit a high-touch issue, how long are they waiting for support?        The difference in wait time between average and leading organizations is nearly 27 hours. Why? Best-in-class organizations triage issues to the right person, improve communications between stakeholders, and accelerate comments. But this can be difficult to manage. With AI, however, companies are able to take much of the friction out of solving these complex functions.  To help employees, you need to first understand what they’re asking for. Using NLU (natural language understanding) and NLP (natural language processing) models, industry-leading companies can significantly speed up complicated processes.    Access issues  There are several use cases — password resets, account unlocks — where it might take an agent minutes to perform the task, but the ticket sits in the queue for hours. Industry-leading companies use this as an opportunity to introduce a back-end automation tool to trigger workflows. The difference is shocking: a 15-hour discrepancy that employees experience whenever they’re locked out of an account.   How long do employees wait for access?        In the age of hybrid work, not all employees are able to walk over to their favorite help desk agent and describe their problem in seconds. Leading companies use AI to transition that experience, seamlessly, to a digital workplace.    Troubleshooting questions  All help desks have a collection of knowledge base articles, documenting solutions that only specialists at the company would know. Innovative leaders use AI to transform these long, hard-to-reach articles into bite-sized solutions.  In conventional organizations, it takes a lot of time and effort from the help desk agent to offer a customized solution to an employee, impacting wait times.    How long do employees wait to get their questions answered?        There’s a 10-hour difference in wait time between companies that leverage automation and those that don’t.  Employees expect personalized solutions, and IT agents spend hours gathering information before coming up with the perfect answer. At leading companies, this process is automated — AI is used to gather all context around employee requests, so help desk agents can have a 360-degree view while answering questions.     The impact of approvals  There are some use cases that need managerial input. But getting a manager’s attention can be tough at times.    How long are employees waiting for approvals?        People wait nearly 40 hours for approvals due to the primary mode of communication: email and siloed support channels. But automated support happens in real time. In this category, leading organizations are able to attack the root of the problem: poor communication.   Industry-leading companies have incorporated conversational AI to bring these requests to an enterprise chat platform, allowing managers to give approvals as soon as they see their employees’ messages.  To move from an average company to one that’s leading the pack, you will have to prioritize the employee experience. Conversational AI is a powerful tool, with limitless applications. It can help your help desk agents eliminate their pain points and significantly reduce employees’ wait times.
